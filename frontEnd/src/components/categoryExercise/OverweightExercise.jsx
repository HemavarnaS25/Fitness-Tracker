      <p> The goal here is to move consistently and feel great!</p>
      <h3> Start with Gentle Movement</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Brisk walking for 20-30 minutes daily.</li>
        <li>Low-impact exercises like swimming or cycling.</li>
        <li>Chair exercises or seated workouts for mobility.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3> Gradually Add Strength Training</h3>
      <p>Use resistance bands or light weights twice a week.</p>
      <h3>Make It Fun!</h3>
      <p>Try dance workouts, jump rope, or play your favorite music while exercising.</p>
      <h3> Listen to Your Body</h3>
      <p>Don't rush. Small, consistent efforts bring long-term results.</p>
